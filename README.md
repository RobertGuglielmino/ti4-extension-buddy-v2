This is an extension helper for the TI4 Twitch Extension. It provides a dashboard to view the game state, as well as a tray icon to quickly access the dashboard.

# INSTALLATION

Go to the most recent releases section and download the appropriate installer for your OS.

## HOW IT WORKS

This is how the setup for everything works. For this version, you'll need to set up this application, as well as [Streamer Buddy](https://github.com/TI4-Online/TI4-Streamer-Buddy/tree/main).

At some point, they will unite into one application. Today is not that day.

## WINDOWS

The Installer is directly available. Download it, and run it. That should be it!

## MACOS

There are two different versions available. If you don't know whether you should choose `.zip` or `.dmg`, choose `.zip` :)

The first time you open the app, there's an error that it can't be verified. This is okay! Just do the following:
- Open "privacy and security" settings
- Scroll down to the warning
- Click "open anyway"

It'll open normally later after this.
